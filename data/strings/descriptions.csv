NWP_depolarizationbeam,WEAPON,"A hyperspecialized beam-esque weapon that depolarizes flux within flux capacitors, causing de-integration with barytronic stabilizers and violent p-space flux shunting.

The Phasic Depolarizer was originally developed by Bhilai Exospace as an unfortunate, but effective method at clearing flux back-phase loops from hard-to-reach conduits and capacitors. Once directed at a target, the Depolarizer's integrated anti-phase recoil generator charges the outgoing neutrinos and sub-tachyons on various dimensions, creating a sub-hyperwave distortion field surrounding each particle. When these fields collide with areas containing hyperdimensional shunt feedback, such as flux, the feedback energies will begin to be forcefully depolarized by the anti-phasic effects of the distortion field. Once a sufficient instability is reached, commonly known as ""critical instability"", sufficiently unstable flux will begin violently shunting back into hyperspace, firing off metaphysical shockwaves of phasic energy. This shunting excites other instances of flux, which will be destabilized further by the shunting, causing themselves to shunt. This causes an unstoppable chain-reaction of shunting, which, depending on energy levels, will release enough phasic energy to severely damage nearby matter.

Prior to the collapse, these operations often spanned hours, days, or even weeks, as to minimize the effect of the chain-shunting by controlling the power of the disruption field. It was still not enough to prevent minor damages, however, and the tool was quickly deprecated in favor of other less destructive options. Hence, the extreme rarity of the depolarizer in comparison to other beam-based machinery. 

While Bhilai Exospace may have written this weapons destructive capabilities off, the Persian Sector clearly has not. This weapon is very sought after by those that know of it, and know of it's true potential; a few rudimentary overclocking efforts can increase the anti-phase recoil generator's power by nearly 500%. This translates to an approximate 7 second focus period prior to casualty instability on most, if not all, ships.  ",Special,,
